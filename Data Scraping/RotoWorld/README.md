# RotoWorld

To test the connection between betting lines and the players' injuries, we used selenium to extract injury status reports from RotoWorld that contained live-time data of the NBA players.

The problem with the data is the absence of a label, meaning we have descriptions of status but not a label for it, so we tagged the data using simple patterns, but since some patterns were not enough accurate in this case, we performed the tagging manually.
